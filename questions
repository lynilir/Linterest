how come my random function didn't work? it has something to do with
default value for array right?

do i want users to be able to delete pins or just delete pinnings?
when a user deletes a pin in their board,
it should just delete pinning right?

how do

nav bar nested check

will changing a nested thing in parent slice of state cause re-render?

user profile pic didn't change...
